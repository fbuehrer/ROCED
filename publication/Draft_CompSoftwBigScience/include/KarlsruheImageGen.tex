Another option to employ a fully-automated procedure is to use the OZ toolkit~\cite{OZ}. All requirements and configuration options of an image can be specified via an XML file, called template. The partitioning and installation process of the operating system is fully automated, as OZ will use the remote-control capabilities of the local hypervisor. After the installation of the operating system, additional libraries and configuration files can be installed. Once the image has been built, it is automatically compressed and uploaded to a remote cloud site.
Using this technique allows to build images in a reproducible fashion, as all templated files are version controlled using git. Furthermore, existing template files are easy to adapt to new sites and experiment configurations.
