As a realistic job which could be run by ATLAS users on the NEMO
cluster, the production of simulated events with the Monte Carlo
generators PowhegBox and Pythia8 has been executed in the virtual
machines.
These jobs do not constitute the best-case scenario but rather
realistic conditions from the point of view of the user.
