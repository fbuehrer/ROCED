The open-source HTCondor project provides a workload management system which is highly configurable and modular~\cite{HTCondor}. Batch processing workflows can be submitted and are then forwarded by HTCondor to idle resources. HTCondor maintains a resource pool, which worker nodes in a local or remote cluster can join. Once HTCondor has verified the authenticity and features of the newly joined machines, computing jobs are automatically transferred. Special features to connect from within isolated network zones, for example via a NAT-Portal, to the central HTCondor pool are available. The Connection Brokering (CCB) service is especially valuable to connect virtual machines to the central pool. These features and the well-known ability of HTCondor to scale to O(100k) of parallel batch jobs lets us decide to use HTCondor as a workload management system.

The virtual machines spawned for the CMS user group of the KIT come with the HTCondor client (\texttt{startd}) pre-installed and this client is started after the machine has fully booted and connects to the central HTCondor pool at the KIT via a shared secret. Due to HTCondor's dynamic design, new machines in the pool will automatically receive jobs and the transfer of the job configuration and meta-data files is handled via HTCondor's internal file transfer systems.
