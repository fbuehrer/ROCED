This paper presents the concepts and implementation of providing a HPC
resource to ATLAS and CMS users accessing external clusters connected
to the World-wide computing grid (WLCG) with the purpose of running
data production as well as data analysis on the HPC host system.
For this purpose, the HPC cluster NEMO at the University of Freiburg
is deploying an OpenStack instance to handle the virtual machines.
The schedulers on the NEMO and the external resources are connected
through the ROCED service\cite{ROCED}.
